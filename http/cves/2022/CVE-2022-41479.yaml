id: CVE-2022-41479
info:
  name: DevExpress IDOR to application source code
  author: CravateRouge
  severity: high
  description: |
    The DevExpress Resource Handler (ASPxHttpHandlerModule) in DevExpress ASP.NET Web Forms Build v19.2.3 does not verify the referenced objects in the /DXR.axd?r= HTTP GET parameter. This leads to an Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability which allows attackers to access the application source code
